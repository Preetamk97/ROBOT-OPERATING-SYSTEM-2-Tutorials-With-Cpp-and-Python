# Project 3.2. Using OpenCV With ROS2 Services (Python)

# Problem Statement

1. Create a **custom service interface** named **TurnCameraService.srv** which consists of a **request** message named “**angle**” of type “**float32**” and a **response** message named **“image”** of type “**sensor_msgs/Image**”.
2. Create a **Service Client** node named **turn_camera_client.py** which uses the **TurnCameraService.srv** custom service interface to **send** the **request** message **“angle”** to a Service Client node via a service named **/turn_camera -** to turn the robot camera to a specified angle.
3. Create a **Service Server** node named **turn_camera_server.py** which uses the **TurnCameraService.srv** custom service interface to **receive** the **request** message **“angle”** from the Service Client and then processes this information to send back an **image response message** of **.png** format - that the robot takes after turning the camera by the instructed **angle** value.
4. The **Service Client** node should display the image received from the **Service Server.** 
5. Now, since we do not have a real robot and haven’t learned about making simulations yet, we are just going to have some pre-taken images - which are named by an angle - and store them inside the **ros2_py_udemy_tutorial/src/udemy_ros2_pkg/images** folder - from where we can use them in our code and return one of these images based on the **request** message **angle.**
6. You can click some images on your own. Name them one by one as -30, -15, 0, 15 & 30 respectively. Store these images inside the **ros2_py_udemy_tutorial/src/udemy_ros2_pkg/images** folder.

# Additional Software Requirements

1. **OpenCV** library which is a free open-source computer vision library.
2. **CVBridge** package which is a **ROS2** **package** that helps us to convert **images** from **ROS Image Message** type to **OpenCV Image** type and vice-versa.

# Installing OpenCV and CVBridge

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python3-opencv libopencv-dev  # Installing OpenCV
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-cv-bridge # Installing CV Bridge
```

- To check if **OpenCV** is installed properly in your Ubuntu System, run the following commands from the same terminal.
    
    ```bash
    python3
    import cv2
    cv2.__version__   # On pressing ENTER you should see the opencv version
    
    exit()
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](Images/Project3.2/Untitled.png)
    
- Another way to check **OpenCV** Version is to run the following command from the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    dpkg -s libopencv-dev
    ```

# Include Dependencies in `package.xml`

```xml
<depend>OpenCV</depend>
<depend>cv_bridge</depend>
```

# Include Dependencies in `CMakeLists.txt`

```python
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)  
find_package(cv_bridge REQUIRED)
```

# Write the code for **`TurnCameraService.srv`** Custom Service Interface

```bash
float32 angle  # Request Message
---
sensor_msgs/Image image  # Response Message

# If we are using any other message interface - other than the "std_msgs/msg/" primitive datatype interfaces (ex - int64, float32, float64, bool, string etc.) - to define our request or response message - then we must mention the complete interface name - as it appears on the 'ros2 interface list' - ommitting the /msg/ part in between - while mentioning the datatype of the message. 

# Example - "sensor_msgs/Image" image 

# Here, while mentioning the type of response message "image", we do not use /msg/ explicitly because ROS knows that we cannot use any other interface - other than the "Message" type interfaces as datatypes for request and response messages, while defining a custom service interface.
```

# Include **`TurnCameraService.srv`** Custom Service Interface in `CMakeLists.txt` file

```python
# Adding the below dependency since we are using sensor_msgs library in 
# the TurnCameraService.srv interface and some of our python codes in this package.
find_package(sensor_msgs REQUIRED)

# Telling our compiler exactly what new custom interfaces files we have created in our package
# that needs to have the ros idl code generated for it.
rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  "srv/OddEvenCheck.srv"
  "srv/TurnCameraService.srv"
  DEPENDENCIES 
  sensor_msgs
)
# ${PROJECT_NAME} signifies the name of our package (udemy_ros2_pkg)

# sensor_msgs/msg/Image is the type of message interface that we are using inside the 
# TurnCameraService.srv as response message datatype. Since this message interface does 
# not belong to the group of standard message intefaces (std_msgs/msg/**), 
# therefore, we need to include this complete package of sensor_msgs as a dependency in the above code of rosidl_generate_interfaces.
```

# Importing OpenCV and CvBridge Into the Python Code:

```python
import cv2
from cv_bridge import CvBridge
```

# Converting ROS Image Message into OpenCV Image Format

```python
opencv_image = CvBridge().imgmsg_to_cv2(ros_image) 
```

# Display Image In OpenCV Window

```python
cv2.imshow("Display Window Name", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)  # Notice that the K of waitKey is capital.
								# Zero (0) signifies that image display window should stay 
								# open until we close it by pressing the ENTER key.
cv2.destroyAllWindows()  # Closing all opencv windows.
```

# Reading An Image From File

```python
opencv_image = cv2.imread(complete_file_location)
```

# Converting OpenCV Image To ROS Image Message

```python
opencv_image = cv2.imread(complete_file_location)
ros_image = CvBridge().cv2_to_imgmsg(opencv_image)
```
