# Chapter 2. Environment Setup

In this chapter, we are going to setup the **Humble Version of ROS2** and **VS Code** in our **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** OS.

It is assumed/expected that you already have **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  *or any later version of the OS***  installed on your computer and are familiar with the basic Terminal Commands of Ubuntu.

## Installing ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu OS:

1. **Open Terminal :** Shortcut for opening terminal is (**Ctrl + Alt + T**)
2. **Right Click on the Terminal icon** → Select “**Add to Favorites**” → So that we can access it easily in the future.
3. **Run** `sudo apt update`
4. **Install Tilix →** **Run** `sudo apt install tilix` → **Hit Y** → **Enter**.
5. **Configure Tilix** → Open Tilix Terminal → Click on **the 3-line-button** beside search button at the top of Tilix Terminal Window → Select **Preferences** → Go to **Default** Tab → Go to **Command** Tab → Check “**Run the command as a login shell**” → You can go to **Color** tab and do some design customizations of your own for the terminal.
6. Close all the terminals.
7. Reopen Tilix Terminal. You can add more terminals using the “**Add terminal right**” & “**Add terminal down**” buttons at the top-left of Tilix Terminal Window. 
8. Go to the [**ROS2 Humble Offical Documentation**](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) Site. 
9. Click on **Installation** → Click on “**Debian Packages**” under “**Ubuntu Linux - Jammy Jellyfish (22.04)**”. The steps below are borrowed from the **Ubuntu (Debian)** page.
10. **Set Locale** : Run the following commands on **Tilix** terminal one by one.
    
    ```bash
    locale  # check for UTF-8
    
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
    sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
    sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    
    locale  # verify settings
    ```
    

1. **Troubleshooting For Future: (**[https://www.debugpoint.com/failed-connect-raw-githubusercontent-com-port-443/](https://www.debugpoint.com/failed-connect-raw-githubusercontent-com-port-443/)**)**
    
    - Run `sudo nano /etc/hosts` 
    
    - Then at the end of this file, add the IP address: `185.199.108.133 raw.githubusercontent.com`
    
    ![Untitled](Images/Chapter2/Untitled.png)
    
    Save and close the file.
    
2. **Setup Sources:** Run the following commands on Tilix terminal one by one.
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install software-properties-common
    
    sudo add-apt-repository universe
    
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
    
    sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
    
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
    ```
    

1. **Install ROS 2 Packages:** Run the following commands on Tilix terminal one by one.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade

    #If you get any problem on running the above command.
    #Try running "sudo dpkg --configure -a" to troubleshoot.
    #Run "sudo apt upgrade" again.
    ```

    - **Desktop Install (Recommended) - Used :** ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
        ```
        
    - **ROS-Base Install (Bare Bones) - Not Used**: Communication libraries, message packages, command line tools. No GUI tools.
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-base
        ```
        
    - **Development tools - Not Used**: Compilers and other tools to build ROS packages
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
        ```
    
    Go with the **Desktop Install (Recommended).** 
    
    ROS2 Humble is now successfully installed on your system. 
    
    Cheers !
    
1. **Environment Setup (Sourcing the script):** You need to run this command everytime you open a new terminal to use ROS 2 on it.
    
    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

    # You need to run this command everytime you open a new terminal to use Ros2 on it.
    # Replace ".bash" with your shell if you're not using bash
    # Possible values are: setup.bash, setup.sh, setup.zsh
    ```
    

1. **Try some commands to see if its working:**
    
    To check if you installed `ros-humble-desktop`  correctly as instructed above, you can try below commands.
    
    In one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++ `talker`:
    
    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
    ```
    
    In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python `listener` :
    
    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
    ```
    

    You should see the `talker` saying that it’s `Publishing` messages and the `listener` saying `I heard` those messages. This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.

    Hooray!


1. **Automating the** `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` **Command:**  
Go to **Tutorials** page of ROS2 Humble Documentation → Under **Beginner: CLI tools,** click on **Configuring environment →** Scroll down to **Add sourcing to your shell startup script section → Execute the below given command in a Terminal for one time** → And now, you wont have to run the command `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`  - every time you open a new terminal - - for using ROS 2 - ever again !
    
    ```bash
    echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
    
1. **To check the version of ROS installed - on Terminal** - run the below command:
    
    ```bash
    printenv | grep -i ROS
    ```
    
1. **Uninstall:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt remove ~nros-humble-* && sudo apt autoremove
    
    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt autoremove
    
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```
    

## Installing VS Code on Ubuntu OS:

1. **Install** **VS Code** from **Ubuntu Software Center.**
2. **Install VS Code Extensions**:
    - **C/C++ Extension Pack** by Microsoft.
    - ****Python Extension Pack**** by Don Jayamanne.
    - **ROS** by Microsoft.
    - **Code Runner** by Jun Huan

1. Click on **Manage Gear Icon** at the **left bottom** corner of **VS Code** Window → **Settings** → Extend the tab **Extensions** → Click on **ROS** (Under **Extensions**) → Write **humble** in the box under **Ros: Distro**

## Setting Up C++ Environment on Ubuntu OS:

1. First, check to see whether **GCC** is already installed on your Ubuntu system. To verify, open a Terminal window and enter the following command:
    
    `gcc -v`
    

1. If GCC isn't installed, run the following command from the terminal window to update the Ubuntu package lists. An out-of-date Linux distribution can sometimes interfere with attempts to install new packages.
    
    `sudo apt update`
    
    `sudo apt upgrade`
    
2. Next install the **GNU Compiler Tools** and the **GDB Debugger** with this command:
    
    `sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb`
    

## Setting Up Python Environment on Ubuntu OS:

You can download the Python package from the official Ubuntu repository. Here's how to do it:

1. Open up your terminal by pressing **Ctrl + Alt + T**.
2. **Upgrade and update Ubuntu to the latest version**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```

1. Download and Install the latest version of Python:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3
    ```

1. To check if **python** is successfully installed in your system, run the given command from any terminal:
    
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
