# Chapter 6.1 Configuring Packages (C++)

In the last lesson, we **wrote** the code for a **C++ ROS2 Publisher Node** which sends a string type message ‚Äú**Hello World :** ‚Äù followed by an integer that increments each time  -  inside the **src** folder of **udemy_ros2_pkg** package of our **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace. 

Now, to run the piece of code we need to **compile/build** it first and create an executable (**.exe**) file.

In ROS2, the **default C++ build system** is called **ament_cmake**. **ament_cmake** is the build system for CMake based packages in ROS 2 (in particular, it will be used for most if not all C/C++ projects). And we will use **ament_cmake** to build our C++ code with the **colcon** command line tool**.**

The core instructions of building our **udemy_ros2_pkg** package are stored inside the  **CMakeLists.txt** file of the **package folder**.

**Step 1**. Open the **CMakeLists.txt** file of the **udemy_ros2_pkg** package folder in **VS Code**.

**Step 2**. Add the following lines of code to the **CMakeLists.txt** file anywhere before the last line **ament_package()**

```cpp
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)

add_executable(publisher src/publisher.cpp) 
ament_target_dependencies(publisher rclcpp std_msgs)

install(TARGETS
  publisher
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```

**CMakeLists.txt** file code after adding the above lines of code:

```bash
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)
project(udemy_ros2_pkg)

if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX OR CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "Clang")
  add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)
endif()

# find dependencies
find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
# uncomment the following section in order to fill in
# further dependencies manually.
# find_package(<dependency> REQUIRED)
**find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)**

if(BUILD_TESTING)
  find_package(ament_lint_auto REQUIRED)
  # the following line skips the linter which checks for copyrights
  # comment the line when a copyright and license is added to all source files
  set(ament_cmake_copyright_FOUND TRUE)
  # the following line skips cpplint (only works in a git repo)
  # comment the line when this package is in a git repo and when
  # a copyright and license is added to all source files
  set(ament_cmake_cpplint_FOUND TRUE)
  ament_lint_auto_find_test_dependencies()
endif()

**add_executable(publisher src/publisher.cpp) 
ament_target_dependencies(publisher rclcpp std_msgs)

install(TARGETS
  publisher
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
)**

ament_package()
```

<aside>
üí° The ROS2 **modules/packages** (**rclcpp & std_msgs**) which contain the header files (**rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp** & **std_msgs/msg/string.hpp**) that we #included in our **publisher.cpp** code are called **dependencies.**

**find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)** & **find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED) :** We need to add the dependencies used in our **publisher.cpp** file inside this find_package() function in the format of  **find_package(<dependency> REQUIRED)

add_executable(publisher src/publisher.cpp) : publisher =** name of the ****executable file that we are going to create for the **publisher.cpp** source code ****file  ****+  **src/publisher.cpp =** location of the source code file.

**ament_target_dependencies(publisher rclcpp std_msgs) : publisher =** name of the ****executable file that we are going to create for the **publisher.cpp** source code ****file  +  **rclcpp std_msgs** = **dependencies** of **publisher.cpp** source code file.

**install(TARGETS
  publisher
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
)                                                                      
:** Here**,
install(TARGETS
  <executable_file_name>
  DESTINATION <address_where_executable_file_will_be_sourced_by_the_terminal>
) 

lib/${PROJECT_NAME}  ‚Äî** This gives the **address/destination** for storing the executable file **publisher** when it is created ; which in this case is a **folder** by the name of **${PROJECT_NAME}** inside the **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial/install/udemy_ros2_pkg/lib** directory. ****The variable **PROJECT_NAME** references our **package name** as written at line no.2 of this **CMakeLists.txt** file code as **project(<project_name>).**

</aside>

<aside>
üí° If you ever want to change your **package name**, you have to change it in 3 places:
  1. The **package folder name.**
  2. **CmakeList.txt** file **Line No.2 ‚Äî project(udemy_ros2_pkg)**
  3. package.xml file **Line No.4 ‚Äî <name>udemy_ros2_pkg</name>**

</aside>

**Step 3**. Add the following code to the **package.xml** file of the **udemy_ros2_pkg** package.

```bash
<depend>rclcpp</depend>
<depend>std_msgs</depend>
```

**rclcpp** & **std_msgs** are the dependencies that our **publisher.cpp** file of the **udemy_ros2_pkg** package uses.

**package.xml** file after the code addition:

```bash
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://download.ros.org/schema/package_format3.xsd" schematypens="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"?>
<package format="3">
  <name>udemy_ros2_pkg</name>
  <version>0.0.0</version>
  <description>TODO: Package description</description>
  <maintainer email="pritam@todo.todo">pritam</maintainer>
  <license>TODO: License declaration</license>

  <buildtool_depend>ament_cmake</buildtool_depend>
  **<depend>rclcpp</depend>
  <depend>std_msgs</depend>**

  <test_depend>ament_lint_auto</test_depend>
  <test_depend>ament_lint_common</test_depend>

  <export>
    <build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>
  </export>

</package>
```

Save your work before proceeding.

**Step 4. Open a new terminal** from the **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace directory. Run the following commands from the terminal:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
# For setting up the ros2 environment in the terminal.
# Not needed if you already have added this command to your bashrc 
# file using the command : echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

colcon build
# For compiling the entire **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace directory.
# After running this command successfully, you can actually see
# the executable file publisher created 
# at **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial/build/udemy_ros2_pkg** folder
# But we will use **ros2 run** command from our terminal to run 
# this **publisher** executable file **-** which will be accessed from 
# **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial/install/udemy_ros2_pkg/lib/udemy_ros2_pkg**

source install/setup.bash
# Sourcing the **setup.bash** file present inside the **install** directory of our 
**# ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace - so that our terminal becomes aware of 
# the location of our **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace.
# After running this command, all the packages built inside 
# **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace will be recognised by the terminal.

# To check if our terminal is sourced with the **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace
ros2 pkg list
# This will give a long list of various ros2 packages in which we can see
# the names of all the packages built inside **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace.
# In this case there is only one package built inside 
# **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace -> the **udemy_ros2_pkg** package.

ros2 run udemy_ros2_pkg publisher
# ros2 run <name_of_package> <name_of_executable>
# This command does not work if we have not sourced our terminal 
# to the **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace folder.
# So please ensure to always run **source install/setup.bash 
#** command before running this command.
```

**Step 5.** After running the last command above we cannot see anything on the terminal because the our ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù messages are broadcasted over **ROS2** **DDS Communication Layer** and **not** as **standard output** to the **terminal**. **To see the messages on terminal, open a second terminal** in the  **ros2_cpp_udemy_tutorial** workspace directory ‚Üí Run the following commands:

```bash
ros2 node list
# Gives list of active nodes'
# /hello_world_pub_node

ros2 topic list
# Gives list of active topics
# /hello_world
# /parameter_events
# /rosout

ros2 topic echo /hello_world
# For listening to the /hello_world topic messages.
```

## Change the name of a Node with ros2 run ‚Äì at run time

You can add many arguments to the `ros2 run` command. Among them, there is one allowing you to directly change the node‚Äôs name at run time, without having to re-write/re-compile anything.

The first thing to add is `-ros-args` . Use `-ros-args` only once, and put all arguments after it.

To change the node‚Äôs name from ‚Äúmy_node‚Äù to ‚Äúanother_node‚Äù, use `r __node:=...:`

```bash
$ ros2 run ros2_tutorials_py minimal_node --ros-args -r __node:=another_node
[INFO] [1593588911.947569209] [another_node]: Node has been started.
```

You can see on the logline: the name of the node has been changed!

This feature will be handy when you want to launch multiple nodes with different names. For example, if you have a ‚Äúsingle_wheel_controller‚Äù node, you can create a ‚Äúright_wheel_controller‚Äù and a ‚Äúleft_wheel_controller‚Äù node, using the same code and executable.

And this is important: **you can‚Äôt start 2 nodes with the same name**, or else expect to see some weird behavior.
