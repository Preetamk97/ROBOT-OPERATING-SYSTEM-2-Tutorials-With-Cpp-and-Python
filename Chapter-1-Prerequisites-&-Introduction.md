# What is ROS2 ?

- **The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.**
- It provides a communication interface for software components (called "nodes") to interact with each other and with the underlying hardware.
- ROS 2 is designed to be flexible and modular, making it easy to build and deploy robot applications in a variety of environments.
- It is commonly used in research and commercial applications to develop and deploy robots that can perform a wide range of tasks, such as navigation, manipulation, and perception.
